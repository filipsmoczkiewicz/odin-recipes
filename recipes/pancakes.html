<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.
